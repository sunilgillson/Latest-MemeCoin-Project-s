> Cryptocurrencies might be in a slump at the moment, but that hasn't stopped investors
from jumping on the crypto bandwagon. While most of the attention is focused on the biggest
names in cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin (BTC -7.84%) and Ethereum (ETH -10.55%), countless newer
coins have popped up over the past few months. "Meme coins" are often written off as a joke, but 
some investors believe they should be taken seriously. Cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE -8.11%) 
have made massive waves in the crypto space, and some people have made a lot of money from these investments.
But are meme coins a smart investment?

> MemeCoin is an dapp, Which is created by sunil Kumar (Sunilgillson@gmail.com);
